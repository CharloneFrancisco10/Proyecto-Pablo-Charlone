			<h3><strong> Auditory Screenings (Tracking Audiometries)</strong></h3><p> Auditory Screenings involve testing an individual's hearing abilities to identify any hearing loss. These screenings track changes in hearing over time, using audiometers to measure responses to different sound frequencies. They are commonly used to monitor auditory health, especially for individuals at risk of hearing deterioration.</p>

			<h3><strong> Sonodamped Cabin:</strong></h3><p> Sonodamped Cabin is a soundproof room used in audiology for accurate hearing tests. It blocks out external noise to ensure precise measurements. These cabins are essential for conducting auditory screenings and audiometric evaluations.</p>

			<h3> <strong>  Logoaudiometry:</strong></h3><p>Logoaudiometry is a type of hearing test that evaluates a personâ€™s ability to understand and identify speech sounds. It typically involves the presentation of words or sentences at varying volumes, and the individual must repeat them back to determine speech comprehension thresholds. This test is useful for diagnosing speech-related hearing issues and assessing speech perception.</p>

			<h3> <strong>Visible speech map:</strong></h3><p>A Visible Speech Map is a tool used in audiology to visualize how well a hearing aid or cochlear implant is amplifying speech sounds for the user. It displays the frequency and intensity of speech sounds in real time, helping audiologists fine-tune the device settings to ensure optimal hearing performance. This map allows for better adjustment by showing the amplification levels at different speech frequencies, ensuring clear and effective communication.</p>

			<h3> <strong>Otoacoustic Emissions:</strong></h3><p>Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) are sounds generated by the inner ear (cochlea) in response to auditory stimuli, typically measured using a small microphone placed in the ear canal. These emissions are used to assess cochlear function, particularly the health of the hair cells in the inner ear. OAEs are often used in newborn hearing screening and to detect early signs of hearing loss, as they are absent or reduced in individuals with cochlear damage.</p>

			<h3> <strong>Evoked Potentials:</strong></h3><p>Electrical responses generated by the brain or nervous system when it is stimulated by sensory input, such as sound or visual stimuli. In audiology, auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) are used to assess the auditory pathways in the brain, helping diagnose hearing disorders and neurological conditions. These tests measure the brain's electrical activity in response to sounds, allowing for the evaluation of hearing function, especially in newborns or individuals who cannot provide behavioral responses.</p>

			<h3> <strong>Impedance Audiometry:</strong></h3><p> Is a test used to assess the function of the middle ear. It measures the movement of the eardrum in response to changes in air pressure, helping detect issues such as fluid in the middle ear, ear infections, or problems with the eustachian tube. This test provides valuable information about the mobility of the eardrum and the overall health of the middle ear, often used in conjunction with other hearing tests to diagnose conductive hearing loss.</p>

			<h3> <strong>Measurement of Acoustic Parameters in Artificial Ears:</strong></h3><p>Measurement of Acoustic Parameters in Artificial Ears refers to the process of evaluating the performance and sound quality of hearing aids or cochlear implants. This involves assessing factors like sound amplification, frequency response, and distortion to ensure the device provides optimal hearing. Audiologists use these measurements to fine-tune the settings and enhance the user's auditory experience.</p>

			<h3> <strong>Real-Ear Verification:</strong></h3><p>Real-Ear Verification is a process used in audiology to assess the performance of a hearing aid directly in the patient's ear. It involves measuring the sound levels in the ear canal with the hearing aid in place, ensuring that the device provides the correct amplification according to the individual's hearing needs. This test helps audiologists fine-tune the hearing aid settings for optimal sound quality and comfort, ensuring the device works effectively in real-world listening environments.</p>
